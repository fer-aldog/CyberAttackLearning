    <string name="virustxt">Computer viruses are a type of malware whose\npurpose
        is to destroy data by attaching itself to\nmultiple files, just like
        an actual, physical virus. Hackers like to create some sort of\ndisruption,
        thinking of it like some funny prank. But others do it to deliberately cause\n
        harm to other people. Through downloading files from the internet, using
        packaged/unpatched software,pen drives, clicking on email attachments or USBs
        and hard drives, the computer gets a program or file with the virus.
        When you open a file or run a program with it, the host computer gets infected.
        Then the virus starts spreading itself to other parts of the computer
        or to other computers.
        \n\nThere are different types of viruses:
        \n- Boot sector: This type of virus destroys a computer through its
        core. It attaches itself on floppy disks, USB drives, or emails, and
        once activated, it heads straight to the master boot record and
        disrupts the computer’s startup process.
        \n- Direct Action:
        \n- Macro:
        \n- Multipartite:
        \n- Overwrite virus:
        \n- Polymorphic:
        \n- Resident:
        \n- Spacefiller:
        \n\nTo protect yourself against viruses, you can:
        \n- Back files up
        \n- Do a virus scan
        \n- Don’t click on suspicious links or pop-ups
        \n- Installing virus detection or antivirus software
        \n- Using a firewall
